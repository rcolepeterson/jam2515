                        This is a proof of concept CRUD application built on the Meteor / Node.js platform.
                  		<br><br>
                  		This app is using real time data, WebSockets and reactive templates, so that any change to the DB will be represented on the screen(s) immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Open up the app in two browser windows and make updates and you will see they stay in sync.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Data is written to and pulled from a client side and server side MongoDB Database, which stays in sync via WebSockets.</li>
                        <li>2. All code (server and client) is written in pure JavaScript.</li>
                        <li>3. All the same APIs are available on the client and the server — including database APIs! — so the same code can easily run in either environment.</li>
                    </ul>
                   
                    <p><strong>
                        Cool things ...
                    	</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. All WebSockets. So no REST endpoints. So no wait and redraw.</li>
                        <li>2. Templates are bound to data so they all auto update.</li>
                        <li>3. When a user makes a change, their screen updates immediately — no waiting for the server. If the server rejects their request or executes it differently, the client is patched up with what actually happened.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>
                        What is this good for?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any application that would be enhanced by users being able to see updates, or communicate in realitime. Leaderboards, analytics, charts, contests, chat and multi player games come to mind.</li>
                    </ul>
